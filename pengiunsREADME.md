## Pengiuns - STaRS Web Application

As part of our Software Development II course with Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu, we have been working on the STaRS Judging Web Application. The STaRS Judging App is designed to be used at events for easy and convenient judging of the content displayed. The powerful sync features allows for real time viewing of the incoming vote submissions. Administrators are able to sort and query the judging results using various criteria and view how each judge voted.
